## Functionality
All this app does is take the user's name, email and password. Upon clicking on the submit button, it validates that all fields were filled out, and that the password and confirm password fields match. If these conditions are not met, error messages appear by the offending fields. Currently, only the first offending field (starting from the top) will contain an error message. Intentionally, password errors will print the same message regardless of whether the field is left empty, or the passwords do not match. If all fields are correctly filled out, the submit button will send a little welcome notification with the user's name included.
